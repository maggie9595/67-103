        <h2>Steven Curtis Chapman - This Moment</h2>
        <p>One might think that 20 years would wear a person down, exhaust their creativity, and diminish their resolve. Not so. In <em>This Moment</em>, Steven Curtis Chapman is as infectiously energetic, artistically creative, and steady as ever. In fact, <em>This Moment</em> breaks new ground and demonstrates the continuing cutting-edge development of a phenomenal artist who has chosen not to focus on himself but on the God who gives such gifts. You just can't put SCC in a box -- he simply can't be defined easily.</p>

        <p>It's the same SCC but different-new songs, new sounds, and fresh energy. I believe there to be more potential hits on this album than anything we've seen before from SCC. <em>Cinderella</em>, <em>Yours</em>, <em>Children of God</em>, <em>With One Voice</em> are all potential chart-toppers. Cinderella is a great song and a potential cross-over hit though I don't think SCC cares whether it crosses over or not. It's a song for fathers and daughters and how the years pass so quickly. Influence of the modern praise and worship music is manifest with the stirring anthems of <em>Yours</em>, <em>Children of God</em>, and <em>With One Voice</em>, all of which could easily be added to the repertoire of Passion Conferences.</p>

        <p>This is the 21st SCC album and it just keeps getting better.</p>
